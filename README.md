## CornCake

Web application to translate a given word, text-to-speech such translation and fetch its corresponding sound via Freesound API (i.e. 'thunder'; italian translation: _tuono_, followed by a clip of a boom of thunder.)

Written in Python, Flask and HTML.

Special thanks to Freesound and the googletrans and gTTS Python libraries, without which this wouldn't have worked at all.

Developed as a gift to Sophia.
